# TourMile
A tourism project which aims to provide new insights about the tourism and hospitality industry as well as improve business decision-making with the power of data analytics and data visualisation.

### Description of each file/folder
1. Search for hotels within the area of tourist attractions in Singapore
An analytical web application which displays and recommends hotels within the area of tourist attractions that have been selected by tourists or any other users according to their interests or preferences.

To view this web application,
a. Clone this repository.
b. Navigate into hotel_search folder.
c. Create a virtual environment by running `virtualenv -p python3 [env-name]`.
d. Activate virtual environment and install dependencies with `pip install -r req.txt`.
e. Run the app.py file by calling `python app.py`.

2. Visualisation of Airbnb listings in Singapore
Surprisingly, there are Airbnb listings in Singapore despite the fact that renting out a place of residence for less than 3 consecutive months is not allowed in Singapore. However, with the available data of Airbnb listings in Singapore, I have visualised the data to analyse which neighbourhood(s) in Singapore has the lowest and highest Airbnb listings. This visualisation can be found in *geospatial_analysis.ipynb*.
Please be responsible to find out and understand the regulations and procedures before leasing or booking an Airbnb accommodation in Singapore.

This repository will be updated over time.
